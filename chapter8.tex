\section{Plans for the more distant future}
I plan to run Peter Diener's simulation of scalar self-force on a Schwarzschild background for generic orbits, and ~\cite{fujita_cardoso}
going to test Peter Diener's generic orbits and help him develop them further.

\begin{eqnarray}
  (\Box - \xi R)\Psi^{ret} = -4\pi q \int\delta_4(x,z(\tau^\prime))d\tau^\prime\\
    ma^\alpha=q(g^{\alpha\beta}_{(0)}+u^\alpha u^\beta)\Psi^{R}_{,\beta}\\
    \frac{dm}{d\tau}=-q u^\alpha\Psi^R_{,\alpha}
\end{eqnarray}
R is the Ricci scalar (0 in Schwarzchild spacetime) and $\xi$ is the coupling to curvature. The first equation gives th scalar wave equation in curved spacetime, with a source. The second equation gives the back-reaction due to acceleration of the particle. Here, $\Psi^R$ is the regularized field. The third equation governs the self-consistent evolution of the mass of the particle.~\cite{WardellSelfForceReview}

\section{Generic orbits}
\subsection{Geodesic evolution}
\subsection{Osculating orbits}



\subsection{methods}
effective source
osculating orbits
time dependent coordinate transformation
world tube
already implemented with accelerated orbits though I have not run these.
future work: make self consistent evolution work. 



\section{ToDO}
He also wants convergence plots of the fit data versus the median data for some bad times. I also want a plot that shows the raw data before the subtraction of the offset for some time. Modify code to use saved raw data.
