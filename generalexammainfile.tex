I would like to thank Peter Diener and Frank L\"{o}ffler for their help and guidance. Niels Warburton and Barry Wardell have provided some of the code for this work. Frank L\"{o}ffler and the Einstein Toolkit grant has also provided some of the funding for this research. I would also like to thank Gabriela Gonzalez for the excellent opportunity to work on LIGO during the time of three detections, which provided me the funding I needed to continue the work detailed in this document. I'd like to thank Juana Moreno for the opportunity to work as LA-SIGMA outreach coordinator my first summer here, which provided funding toward this project.

\begin{abstract}
\vspace{0.55ex}

In this document, I present progress toward self-consistent evolutions for Extreme Mass Ratio inspirals of binary black hole systems, using the scalar self-force approximation with an effective source. Self-consistent evolutions are a critical step toward calculating gravitational wave templates for LISA, in order to resolve late times in the inspiral where the timescale of the orbits evolution is shorter than a period, as the small black hole approaches the plunge.

First I describe the preliminary development of a code base in C++ based on Peter Diener's Fortran scalar self-force simulation~\cite{heffernan_ottewil_wardell_modesum_basisForCode}. I have successfully implemented the wave equation in flat spacetime, reproduced the wave equation in Schwarzschild spacetime without a source, and reproduced circular orbits in Schwarzschild spacetime with an effective source at roundoff precision. However, the effort to implement an independent, state-of-the-art code base was abandoned in favor of working together on Peter Diener's existing simulation when the time scale for development of the C++ code proved too long.

In the second half of this document, I present preliminary results for estimates of the errors from Peter Diener's and Barry Wardell's time domain scalar self-force simulation for eccentric orbits using Niels Warburton's frequency domain initial conditions. I perform a first order Richardson Extrapolation to obtain the self-force at infinite Discontinuous Galkerin order, $F_{inf}$, then sum the spherical harmonic modes to obtain the total self-force as a function of time. Preliminary best choice Discontinuous Galerkin evolution orders, 36 to 40, are estimated based on the absolute and relative differences of the radial self force for each DG order and $F_{inf}$ over one radial oscillation. Preliminary best choice mode-fit parameters, $l_{min}=14$ and $l_{max}=25$, are estimated based on residuals of the l-mode fit and discontinuities attributed to roundoff error in a surface plot of the total radial self force as a function of $l_{min}$ and $l_{max}$. The contributions to the error from the number of terms in the l-mode fit, the choice of end points in the l-mode fit, and the inability to calculate the Richardson extrapolation in real time are comparable and at the level of one part in $10^{4}$. The contribution to the error from the use of constant weight factors in the fit is insignificant. These conclusions are preliminary and will need to be evaluated more thoroughly.

My past research has been on gravitational lensing and cosmology, exoplanets, neutrino oscillations, theoretical particle physics, gravitational waves, gravity gradient noise, and fractional calculus. Most of my background is in simulation, whether statistical or theoretical. I think of myself as a computational physicist and a multi-messenger astronomer.

I have 27 publications or preprints thanks in part to my membership in the LIGO Scientific Collaboration from 2009 to 2011. I made significant contributions to five of these, four related to LIGO and one related to exoplanets. I have also had the opportunity to submit, unsuccessfully, an additional first author paper on the simulation of fractional order circuit devices with Gary Bohannan at Saint Cloud State University.

When interpreting the name on this document, please understand that I am female to male transgendered and that my legal name is Susan Elaine Dorsher but that I go by Steven James Dorsher.
