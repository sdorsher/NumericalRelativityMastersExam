I would like to thank Peter Diener and Frank L\"{o}ffler for their guidance. Peter Diener especially has been very important to me, both as an advisor and personally. Frank L\"{o}ffler and the Einstein Toolkit grant has also provided some of the funding for this research, and I would like to thank him for that and for all of his help. I would also like to thank Gabriela Gonzalez for the excellent opportunity to work on LIGO during the time of three detections, which provided me the funding I needed to continue the work detailed in this document. I would like to thank Juana Moreno for the opportunity to work as outreach coordinator to the LA-SIGMA Research Experience for Undergraduates program my first summer at LSU, which also helped provide funding for this research. My parents, Paul and Joanne Dorsher, and my sister, Patricia Dorsher, also deserve a mention, both for extraordinary moral support and for reading and commenting on this document. My family, friends, and loved ones are the purpose behind this work.

In this document, I present the results of a partially completed project in which I reproduce Peter Diener's simulation~\cite{heffernan_ottewil_wardell_modesum_basisForCode} of a scalar particle on a Schwarzschild background for the purpose of producing Extreme Mass Ratio black hole binary templates for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna to roundoff precision. The goal was to parallelize this code in HPX; a course of action that has been put on hold for the indefinite future. The results do not verify, but are consistent with, Wardell et al.'s circular orbit results from 2012 using a different differencing scheme~\cite{wardell_vega_thornburg_diener}. In the second half of this document, I present preliminary results for estimates of the errors from Peter Diener's and Barry Wardell's time domain scalar self-force simulation for eccentric orbits using Niels Warburton's frequency domain initial conditions. First I perform a first order Richardson Extrapolation to obtain the self-force at infinite Discontinuous Galkerin order, $F_\infty$, then sum the spherical harmonic modes to obtain the total self-force as a function of time. Best choice Discontinuous Galerkin evolution orders, 36 to 40, are estimated based on the absolute and relative differences of the radial self force for each DG order and $F_\infty$ over one radial oscillation. Best choice mode-fit lmin, 14, and lmax, 25, values are estimated based on residuals of the l-mode fit and discontinuities attributed to roundoff error in a surface plot of the total radial self force as a function of lmin and lmax. The long term goal is to make a comparison between self-consistent evolutions and geodesic evolution, ultimately necessary for numerical stability as the particle approaches the horizon. This requires increased accuracy from previous work, motivating our exploration of numerical methods.

My past research has been on comet photometry, x-ray bursts, gravitational lensing and cosmology, exoplanets, neutrino oscillations, theoretical particle physics, gravitational waves, gravity gradient noise, and fractional calculus. Most of my background is in simulation, whether statistical or theoretical. I think of myself as a computational physicist and a multi-messenger astronomer. 

I have 27 publications or preprints thanks in part to my membership in the LIGO Scientific Collaboration from 2009 to 2011. I made significant contributions to five of these, four related to LIGO and one related to exoplanets. I have also had the opportunity to submit, unsuccessfully, an additional first author paper on the simulation of fractional order circuit devices with Gary Bohannan at Saint Cloud State University.

Now I am a fourth year graduate student at Louisiana State University. I have worked on LIGO during the time of three detections. I have had the opportunity to gain experience with multiple techniques for speeding up code with supercomputers in my classes. I have done a little research involving databases and and more involving numerical algorithms. I have the opportunity to continue to contribute to the field of general relativity and to participate in a department where my broad background in the connections between various fields of astronomy is valued. I have helped supervise undergraduate research progress and made a lesson plan for and taught a graduate class, once. This document contains the research I have produced in the last three years since I arrived on June 3, 2014 at LSU and began working with Peter Diener.

When interpreting the name on this document, please understand that I am female to male transgendered and that my legal name is Susan Elaine Dorsher but that I go by Steven James Dorsher.
