I would like to thank Peter Diener and Frank L\"{o}ffler for their guidance. Peter Diener especially has been very important to me, both as an advisor and personally. I would also like to thank Gabriela Gonzalez for the excellent opportunity to work on LIGO during the time of three detections, which provided me the funding I needed to continue the work detailed in this document. I would like to thank Juana Moreno for the opportunity to work as outreach coordinator to the LA-SIGMA Research Experience for Undergraduates program my first summer at LSU, which also helped provide funding for this research. My parents, Paul and Joanne Dorsher, also deserve a mention, both for extraordinary moral support and for the financial support they provided that helped make this possible. I would also like to thank my sister Patricia Dorsher, my grandmother Evie Dorsher and her sister Gwen Helbling, and my Aunt Peggy Bennett, and my Aunt Elaine Shirley for being my anchor. I would like to thank my friends Christy Paulson, Hope Ring, Steve Brandt, Brad Schaefer, Luke, and Josh McKeown for their company and kindness during this process. My family, friends, and loved ones are the purpose behind this work.

My past research has been on comet photometry, x-ray bursts, gravitational lensing and cosmology, exoplanets, neutrino oscillations, theoretical particle physics, gravitational waves, and gravity gradient noise. Most of my background is in simulation, whether statistical or theoretical. I think of myself as a computational physicst and a multimessenger astronomer, though I am not sure that term is widely used. What I mean by it is that I have a broad background in particle physics, particle astrophysics, gravitational wave astronomy, and traditional astronomy. If we can consider my various meanderings as one path toward these two goals, I have been walking this path for more than a decade.

Now I am a fourth year graduate student at Louisiana State University, exactly where I intended to be. My coworkers are good friends. I got to perform photometry of exoplanets with a telescope and analyze the data for myself, bringing a previous project full circle. I have worked on LIGO during the time of three detections. I have had the opportunity to begin to learn multiple techniques for speeding up code and measuring that speed up on supercomputers. I have done a little work with databases and and more with numerical algorithms, and learned a couple of new programming languages. I have had the opportunity to continue to contribute to the field of general relativity and participate in a department where my broad background in the connections between various fields of astronomy is valued. I have helped supervise undergraduate research progress and made a lesson plan for and taught a graduate class, once. This document contains the research I have produced in the last three years since I arrived on June 3, 2014 at LSU and began working with Peter Diener. These have been the best three years of my life.

When interpreting the name on this document, please understand that I am female to male transgendered and that my legal name is Susan Elaine Dorsher but that I go by Steven James Dorsher.
