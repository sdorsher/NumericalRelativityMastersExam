\section{ToDO}
He also wants convergence plots of the fit data versus the median data for some bad times. I also want a plot that shows the raw data before the subtraction of the offset for some time. Modify code to use saved raw data.

Need a max number of iterations addition to the loop around alphamax and alphamin selection in extrapolate7.py and bestinfselector.py. test with tempbestinfscript
