Page 5: You still write that g^{\alpha\beta} is the metric. It's not. The
        has indices down.

Page 6: Your notation for writing down the metric is still bad.
        Just write that g_{\mu\nu} = the matrix [ ].

Page 8: You still have du/dt too much in the B term.

Page 8, section 2.2: You now writes that DG has three benefits but lists two.

Page 8, section 2.2.1: The stencil extends n/2 points to either side, if n is

Page 8, section 2.2.1: The correct formula for the total number of points in
        stencil is n+2, if n is the order. Again 2nd order -> 3 points and
        4th order -> 5 points total.

Page 9: Equation 2.6: There is not text describing this equation. You also
        use a strange notation for the second radial derivative.

         state vector from external to the element is coupled to the in-going
         velocity then added to the state vector internal to the element
         coupled to the outgoing velocity."

Page 11, section 2.4: I think you mean to say that you set the initial
         conditions for phi to the radial derivative of psi.

Page 11, section 2.4: You could comment on the superconvergence in the main
         text instead of saying that both Figures 2.3 and 2.4 matches
         expectations.

Page 14, equation 3.2: I would write the last derivative as
         g^{\mu\nu}\partial_{\nu}\Psi to make the dependence on the
         inverse metric explicit.

Page 17, equation 3.10: The formatting of the equation is bad. The second
         line should be aligned with what is right of the equal sign in the
         first line.

Page 17, section 3.2: The wording is clumsy here and still mixes in concepts
         from the particle case. You are testing the code without a source
         and the only thing to do is set up initial data and let it evolve.

Page 18, section 3.2.1: It's the l-value that determines the qnm frequencies,

Page 18, section 3.2.2: Use curly braces to format superscripts properly (as
         in t^{-(2 l+2)}.

Page 18, section 3.2.2: For the initial conditions you're plotting in Figure
         3.3 and 3.4, the expectation is t^{-(2 l+3)}. Otherwise l=1
         would not be matched by t^-5.

Page 22, equation 4.5: This equation would make more sense to the reader if
         you wrote \Box \Psi^R = \Box (\Psi^{ret}-\tilde{\Psi}^S) as the
         text that describes how the delta function is cancelled comes next.

Page 22, after equation 4.5: You don't give any reason for why the window
         function is introduced. Hint: it's due to the fact that we only
         know an approximation of the Detweiler-Whiting singular field.

Page 22, after equation 4.5: Subtraction of the box operator acting on
         the Detweiler-Whiting singular field cancels the delta function
         exactly. We are left with a regular effective source due to the
         fact that we don't know the exact Detweiler-Whiting singular field
         away from the particle.

Page 27, equation 5.4: Whenever you take derivatives of \Psi it should be
         partial derivatives.

Page 27, equation 5.4: You should mention that this is leaving out the
         potential term.

Page 27, after equation 5.4: You could simply say that derivatives of the
         field need to be transformed appropriatlely at the element boundary
         between the time-dependent region and the hyperboloidal regions when
         the numerical fluxes are computed (in addition to the addition and/or
         subtraction of the singular field).

Page 33, section 6.1: There is no description of where equations 6.1 to 6.4
         are coming from. There is no explanation, before the equations, that

         the parameters in the error model.

Page 34, Manually correcting badly selected automatic values bullet point:
         You say "This time is particularly bad,..." but does not say what
         time you're talking about. In the next sentence you say that l=2
         and t=632 M is shown in Table 6.1. Is that the time you're talking
         about.

Page 34, Manually correcting badly selected automatic values bullet point:
         You say that Figure 6.2 is an example of no solution being found, but
         the caption to that figure says that the value of F_inf is subtly 
         wrong.

Page 34, Manually correcting badly selected automatic values bullet point:
         Regarding 6.4, you talk about a possible limitation in the root
         finding method. To me it looks quite like roundoff error. Sometimes
         the value is too high, sometimes it is too low.

Page 35, Table 6.1: if you look at the numbers, they are all compatible with
         a value of 2.4097530, i.e. they all agree to 8 decimal places. This
         is incredibly good agreement, so even you don't see clear convergence
         with order, it's still useful data. You may want to comment on that.

Page 39, section 6.2.2: You say see mode zero for an example. Where can the
         reader see this? Is there a plot?

Page 39, section 6.2.3: References to 2 Figures are screwed up (shown as ??).

Page 39, section 6.2.3: What do you mean that "the fit technique becomes
         more important"? Do you expect it to be better than the median
         method?

Page 43, section 6.3: Does this not belong as a subsection in section 6.2
         (i.e. should it not be section 6.2.4). Shouldn't it also be
         considered a fourth approach (you have already mentioned 3).

Page 44, section 6.3: Your statement in parenthesis "(though this will take
         significantly more work to implement) puzzles me. Why should it take
         a lot of effort to change the upper limit of a sum from 30 to 24 (or
         any other number; make it a parameter)?

Page 44, section 6.3: Last statement about the error. What error are you
         talking about here? The sum of modes or individual modes? Is this
         absolute or relative error? Is there a plot to back up this statement?
         Is this referring to Figure 6.10?

Page 45, figure 6.11: use curly braces with superscripts, $10^{-4}$.

Page 46, chapter 7: This is a comment to all of chapter 7. There is no
         consistency with ragrd to which method of determining f_inf you
         are using in the different plots. Hence, it's very difficult for
         the reader to disentangle what differences are coming from the fits
         and what differences are coming from the f_inf determination.
         I realize that there is not much time, but it would be nice
         if a bit more consistency would be possible. Your last two plots
         of chapter 6 was using the asymptote method. Was the conclusion
         that this was the best method? Or was one of the other methods
         determined to be superior? If so, wouldn't it be better to only use
         f_inf values determined by the best method.

Page 46, chapter 7: You use F_{\infty} here instead of F_{inf} as you did
         earlier. Please choose one and stick to it.

Page 48, figure 7.1: Why is the data bad at high l here and not in figure 7.2.
         Isn't it the same plot. As we discussed, get rid of this.

Page 47, section 7.1: If you get rid of Figure 7.1, you have to rewrite this
         section and argue for why sigma might be important for purely 
         theoretical reasons. You will then also have to comment somewhere
         after presenting the results, that sigma doesn't seem to make too
         much difference.

Page 49, section 7.1: There is a reference to a Figure screwed up (shown as ??).

Page 50, figure 7.2: What modes are used in the fit? If you get rid of Figure
         7.1, you have to change the caption here. Could it be that the
         difference between Figure 7.1 and Figure 7.2 is which modes are 
         included in the fit?

Page 53, figure 7.5: typo in plot title: ponits -> points.

Page 54, figure 7.6: What are you trying to say with the sentence: "Aphelion,
         where this effect is worst."? That this data is from a time close to
         Aphelion? Btw, what is the right word here? Apastron might be better
         than Aphelion, though this is not an orbit around a star, either. 
         Anyhow, choose one and make sure to use a consistent word everywhere.

Page 54, section 7.3: A figure reference is screwed up (shown as ??).

Page 54, section 7.3: The sentence "The three different measurement techniques
         described in Chapter 6" is incomplete (as it was in the last version).

Page 56, figure 7.8: The caption say that you're using the mixed method defined
         in chapter 6. There is no mixed method defined there (The last non-NaN
         method, the median method, the fit method and the asymptote method are
         defined). The plot legends say Minimum, Median and Maximum. However,
         in the current version there is no mention of then Minimum and
         Maximum methods.

Page 55, figure 7.7. Same question regarding the even shorter sentence. 
         "Aphelion."

Page 56, section 7.3.1: I'm still not sure that the difference of the averages
         defined as in Figure 7.6 (including data up to l=30) and Figure 7.7
         including data only up to 26) makes sense, since Figure 7.6 clearly
         shows that things start to go wrong if l=27 and beyond are included
         in the fit. Would something like the maximum value minus the mean
         (or mean minus the minimum value) in Figure 7.7 be a better estimate
         of the error?

Page 57, section 7.3.1: use curly brace in $10^{-4}$ in a couple of places.

Page 59, figure 7.11: How would this look like with a differen method for
         determining f_inf?

Page 59, figure 7.11: The sentence (if you can call it that) "3 term, median
         method." needs to be expanded into a proper sentence.

Page 61, section 8.1: You don't elaborate on the difference between Niels'
         "geodesic evolutions" and our "self-consistent" evolutions. This
         is the main purpose of the future work, so is very important
         to include.

Page 61, section 8.2: It's not the acceleration that evolves, it's the
         orbit itself. This is accounted for by adding an acceleration
         term to the geodesic equation (which is not simplified).

Page 62, equation 8.2: Don't use the (0) subscript on the metric. You haven't
         done so before and there is only the Schwarzschild metric, since
         there is no metric perturbations.

Page 63, section 8.2.2: What do you mean by "touching geodesics"?

Page 63, section 8.2.2: It's probably even more important that it will reduce
         truncation error in the time integration of the orbit.
