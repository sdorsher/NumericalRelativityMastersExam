Note that it is not always possible to choose three points such that they lie on a converging exponential form, for instance, if they are not monotonic, or if they curve in the wrong direction. In these cases, I say that the ``mode failed'', and discard the result for that mode with that starting order for the extrapolation. I use extrapolation starting orders from the set 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, and 36, with additional data at orders 40 and 44 that may be used as points two and three in the extrapolation.

\subsection{ Checking for discontinuities in $F_{\inf}$ for each each l-mode}

In the median approach, the starting orders that did not ``fail'' at each time and for each mode are ordered by their $F_{\inf}$ values. The median value of $F_{\inf}$ is selected, presumably discarding those effected by roundoff and those effected by failure to converge. However, there is no guarantee that it selects those in this regime, since in principle a mode could both be in the roundoff limit and have not converged yet. Yet when this is done, there are no discontinuities in $F_{\inf}$ for any of the l-modes when the median approach is used. See mode zero for an example.

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics{/home/sdorsher/LabNotebook/20170727/finfovertimel0}
  \caption{An example of no discontinuities in $F_{\inf}$ for any of the l-modes. Mode $l=0$.}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Determining $F_{\inf}$ using maximum likelihood fits to subsegments of lines in semilog space}
A better motivated approach, is to fit subsegments of lines in semilog space onthe DG order convergence plot, and find the most linear, longest linear, region. A fit with the ``best'' value of the reduced chi squared should be a good approximation to this. The reduced chi squared is the value of the sum of the residuals of the fit squared divided by the number of degrees of freedom, which in this case is the number of points in the fit minus two, since there are two degrees of freedom in a linear fit. The expectation value of the reduced chi squared, in the limit of a large number of degrees of freedom, is one. I loop over starting and ending points of the fit, and over starting orders, and choose the starting order with the best fit line segment in the sense that that line segment has a reduced chi squared closest to one. An example of such an automatically chosen starting index is given in Figure~\ref{autoconverge}, where there is a long exponentially converging region.
