\section{Gravitational Waves}

On February 11, 2016, the LIGO Scientific Collaboration announced the
first detection of gravitational waves from a black hole binary
inspirals, occurring on September 14, 2015, with pre-merger masses of
36 $M_\odot$ and 29 $M_\odot$ and a post merger mass of 62 $M_\odot$
at a redshift of $z=0.09$~\cite{GW150914}. Two subsequent detections
followed, on December 26, 2015~\cite{GW151226} and on January 4,
2017~\cite{GW170104}, with masses that are about the same to within an order of magnitude.

There is a question of what is meant, observationally, by a black hole. Does it need to have a horizon? Does it need to have a Kerr metric (the simplest possible space-time for a spinning black hole in general relativity)? Does it simply need to be a sufficiently compact object that it can't be ordinary nuclear matter? Historically, black holes have been defined by their compactness~\cite{Bambi2017}; however, some studies are beginning to consider tests of horizons~\cite{} or of the Kerr metric itself~\cite{Bambi2017}. X-ray binaries, gravitational wave constraints from binary-pulsar systems, active galactic nucleii models containing super-massive black holes on the order of $10^6 M_\odot$, and the three LIGO detections, as well as black hole formation models, suggest that black holes of all scales should be spinning~\cite{Bambi2017}. However, for the purposes of this manuscript, I will consider non-spinning, spherically symmetric black holes in general relativity, described by the Schwarzschild metric.

Currently, there are four distinct windows on the gravitational wave universe planned or in progress. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory, LIGO, probably deserves first listing, due to their recent success. LIGO observes gravitational waves using a ground based Michelson-Morley interferometer with two 4 kilometer long Fabry-Perot cavity arms. It detects strains as small as $10^{-23} Hz^{-1/2}$~\cite{LIGOsensitivity}. 



Pulsar timing uses the extremely precise timing of pulsars, taking their spin down into account and correlating with pairs of other pulsars. In this timing, they are looking for residual signals that may be due to supermassive black hole binaries, unmodelled bursts due to various sources including highly eccentric black hole binaries and cosmic string cusps, and the cosmic stochastic gravitational wave background, which should be stronger at the low frequencies where they operate. Existing pulsar timing arrays include the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA), the Eurpeoan Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA), and the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav). They have formed a collaboration called the Interanational Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA). The IPTA is sensitive from $10^{-9}$ to $5\times10^{-8}$ Hz with strains on the order of $10^{-14}$ to $10^{-15}$~\cite{hobbs_dai}.

\section{Notation}
In this manuscript, I use Einstein summation notation for tensors, where a repeated Greek index implies a summation over that repeated index. For example, an $n$ dimensional tensor field of rank (1,2) transforms, in general, according to the rule
\begin{equation}
  T^\alpha_{\beta\gamma}(\bar{x}^1,\ldots,\bar{x}^n)=\Lambda^\alpha_\delta\Lambda^\epsilon_\beta\Lambda^\zeta_\gamma T^\delta_{\epsilon\zeta}(x^1,\ldots,x^n)
\end{equation}
where $\Lambda$ is the jacobian of the coordinate transformation from $x$ to $\bar{x}$. 

Indices are raised by use of the inverse metric and lowered by use of the metric. The metric transforms contravariant one-forms, which constitute the basis, to covariant vectors, which constitute the coordinates, e.g. $u^\beta=g^{\alpha\beta}u_\beta$, where $g^{\alpha\beta}$ is the metric. However, the metric and its inverse can also be used to raise and lower indices of tensors of higher and mixed rank. The metric describes the relative distance between two coordinates on a manifold, in all $n$ dimensions, in an $n\times n$ matrix. Two sign conventions are allowed, depending on whether the time component is positive or negative, though the metric always has a negative determinant in four dimensions. In our sign convention, the Minkowski metric for flat spacetime is given by
\[
\eta^{\mu\nu}=
\begin{bmatrix}
  -1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
  0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
  0 & 0 & 1 & 0\\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
\end{bmatrix}
\]
Here the four dimensions are Cartesian, $t$, $x$, $y$, and $z$. The Schwarzchild metric for a spherically symmetric blackhole without charge or spin is given by
\[
d\tau^2=g^{\mu\nu}
\begin{bmatrix}
  -(1-\frac{2M}{r}) & 0 & 0 & 0\\
  0 & (1-\frac{2M}{r})^{-1} & 0 &0\\
  0 & 0 & r^2 & 0\\
  0 & 0 & 0 & r^2\sin^2\theta
\end{bmatrix}
\]
where $d\tau$ is the proper time, and coordinates are $t$ (the local time), $r$ (a radial coordinate that goes to zero at the singularity, $2M$ at the horizon, and infinity at spatial infinity), $\theta$ (the polar angle), and $\phi$ (the azimuthal angle). To obtain the inverse (lowered) metric, simply invert the matrix representation.
