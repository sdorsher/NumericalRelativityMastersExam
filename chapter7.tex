\section{plans for the future}
going to test Peter Diener's generic orbits and help him develop them further.
\subsection{methods}
effective source
osculating orbits
time dependent coordinate transformation
world tube
already implemented with accelerated orbits though I have not run these.
future work: make self consistent evolution work.
